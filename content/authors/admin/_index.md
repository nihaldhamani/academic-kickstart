Hi, my name is Nihal. I am a software engineer with a passion for autonomy and space exploration. I love tackling tough problems with innovative ideas, some of which you can see down below.

I am currently an undergraduate student at The University of Texas at Austin where I'm majoring in both Computer Science and Astronomy.
